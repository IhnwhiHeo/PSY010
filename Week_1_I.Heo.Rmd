# Recap: Research design

## Research design
To answer your research question, how do you plan to carry out research?

| Experimental method           | Quasi-experimental method  | Correlational method          |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Manipulation of a variable    | Manipulation of a variable | No manipulation of a variable |
| Random assignment             | No random assignment       | Observational                 |
| Causal inference              | Causal inference           | No causal inference           |

## Conditions for causal inference
1. An observed relationship/pattern
2. Temporal precedence
3. Ruling out alternative explanations

# Recap: Research design

## Ask yourself!

### Step 1. Is there **manipulation** of a variable?
If **yes**, that is either an experimental method or a quasi-experimental method.

If **no**, that is a correlational method.

### Step 2. In manipulating a variable, is **random assignment** employed?
If **yes**, that is an experimental method.

If **no**, that is a quasi-experimental method.

# Recap: Measurement

## Measurement

To investigate the properties of studied objects (e.g., people, animals), we assign numbers to them.

.pull-left[
## Observable entities
Physically observable  
Manifest  
Tangible characteristics

**Examples**  
Height, BMI, and heart rate of people  
Test scores on math and language  
How often you meet your friends a week
]

.pull-right[
## Latent construct
Physically unobservable  
Latent  
Psychological characteristics

**Examples**  
Health of people  
Academic achievement  
Extraversion and introversion
]
