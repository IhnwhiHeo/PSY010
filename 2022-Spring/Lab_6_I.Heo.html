## Q&amp;A session for homework 4

# Statistical inference

## Idea 1

### Let's make a best guess about the population parameter and test if that guess is true&lt;br&gt; `\(\rightarrow\)` Estimation and hypothesis testing&lt;br&gt; `\(\rightarrow\)` Our best guess is a sample mean (estimation), and let's test the probability of observing this sample mean or more extreme if the null hypothesis were true (hypothesis testing)

## Idea 2

### Let's assume we are interested in one sample mean and have the distribution of all the possible sample means&lt;br&gt; `\(\rightarrow\)` Sampling distribution of the mean

---

# Hypothesis testing

## In a nutshell

### A form of statistical inference to draw conclusions about population parameters using sample statistics (e.g., sample means)

### How science is conducted and advanced

### One of my research interests is Bayesian hypothesis testing

### But... we learn frequentist hypothesis testing,&lt;br&gt; *a.k.a.*, **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)** :)

---

# Hypothesis testing

## From now on, let me explain a general procedure to you

### Step 1. State null and alternative hypothesis (from your research question)

### Step 2. Select the level of significance, i.e., `\(\alpha\)`

### Step 3. Compute the test statistic (e.g., z-statistic)

### Step 4. Make a statistical decision `\(\rightarrow\)` reject or not reject the null hypothesis

---

# Step 1. State null and alternative hypothesis

## Definition of a hypothesis

### Given an observation, a phenomonen, or a scientific problem, &lt;br&gt;a statement or proposed explanation about the value for a population parameter

&lt;br&gt;

## Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

### We need a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis

---

# Step 1. State null and alternative hypothesis

### Start from your research question &lt;br&gt; "Are UC Merced students friendlier than most other people?"

### **Null hypothesis** `\(\rightarrow\)` nothing is going on; we want to reject this!

### `\(H_{0}\)`: UC Merced students are equally as friendly as or less friendly than most other people `\(\rightarrow\mu_{UCM}\le\mu_{other\:people}\)`

### **Alternative hypothesis** `\(\rightarrow\)` something is going on; we hope to retain this!

### `\(H_{1}\)`: UC Merced students are more friendlier than most other people `\(\rightarrow\mu_{UCM}&gt;\mu_{other\:people}\)`

---

# Step 1. State null and alternative hypothesis

## Depending on research questions, alternative hypotheses can be...

### Directional: expect one group might be greater or less than the other `\(\rightarrow\)` one-tailed
- Is the height of giraffes bigger than polar bears?
  - `\(H_{0}:\mu_{giraffes}\le\mu_{polar\:bears}\)`
  - `\(H_{1}:\mu_{giraffes}&gt;\mu_{polar\:bears}\)`

### Non-directional: focus on only whether there are differences `\(\rightarrow\)` two-tailed
- Does playing music when studying have a different effect on concentration than without music?
  - `\(H_{0}:\mu_{music}=\mu_{no\:music}\)`
  - `\(H_{1}:\mu_{music}\neq\mu_{no\:music}\)`

---

# Step 2 &amp; 3. Select `\(\alpha\)` and compute the test statistic

## Go back to our example
### Say we found that the mean friendliness score was much higher among UC Merced students (Mean = 130) compared to the score in other people (Mean = 100)

## To compare these means...

### Select the level of significance, i.e., `\(\alpha\)`, which is usually .05 (5%)

### Compute the test statistic and obtain the *p*-value &lt;br&gt; `\(\rightarrow\)` If we know the population standard deviation, we use a z-statistic

---

# Step 4. Make a statistical decision

## Say our *p*-value is .03

### There is a 3% chance of getting our sample mean (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis were true (We can still get this sample mean if the null hypothesis is true!)

&lt;br&gt; 

## Note that we usually set `\(\alpha\)` to .05

### Very common in psychology

---

# Step 4. Make a statistical decision

## If our *p*-value is lower than `\(\alpha\)`, we reject the null hypothesis!!!
`\(H_{0}\)`: UC Merced students are equally as friendly as or less friendly than most other people `\(\rightarrow\mu_{UCM}\le\mu_{other\:people}\)`

`\(H_{1}\)`: UC Merced students are more friendlier than most other people `\(\rightarrow\mu_{UCM}&gt;\mu_{population}\)`

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/lab5-pvaluememe.jpeg" width=400&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---

# Step 4. Make a statistical decision

## Wait! Revisit statistical decisions...

### Danniela found that UC Merced students are friendlier. However, **what if UC Merced students are actually not friendlier?**

### Emerald found that UC Merced students are not friendlier. However, **what if UC Merced students are actually friendlier?**

&lt;br&gt;
## These imply that there can be errors in statistical decision making

---

# Type I error

## Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true

### Type I error rate is the alpha (i.e., `\(\alpha\)`)

## False positive
### We think we detected an effect, but in reality, there is not

## Example?
- An allergy test says you are allergic to cats, but you are not. As a consequence, you do not adopt a cat.
- Convict an innocent person of a crime

---

# Type II error

## Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false

### Type II error rate is the beta (i.e., `\(\beta\)`)

## False negative
### We did not detect an effect, but in reality, there is

## Example?
- An allergy test doesn't detect any cat allergy, but you are actually allergic to cats. So, you get sick after the adoption.
- Fail to convict a criminal of a crime

---

# Type I and II errors

## Great... now we know both types of errors

## But... we want a correct decision instead of committing errors

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/lab6-powermeme.jpeg" width=700&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---

# Power

## The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false = `\(1-\beta\)`

# Power

.pull-left[
## Power **increases** when...
### Larger sample sizes
### Larger effect sizes
### Smaller spread
### Larger alpha level
### One-tailed test
]

.pull-right[
## Power **decreases** when...
### Smaller sample sizes
### Smaller effect sizes
### Larger spread
### Smaller alpha level
### Two-tailed test
]

---

# Effect size

## Motivation
### Researchers are down to reject the null hypothesis
### Say, we have a *p*-value lower than the `\(\alpha\)` level (e.g., 0.05) `\(\rightarrow\)` Statistical significance
### Do statistically significant results tell you how much the effects are?

---

# Effect size

## Idea
### Quantify the magnitude of the effect
### Example: mean differences, strength of the relationships, ...

## Implication
### While we can reject the null hypothesis, the effect can be either small or large!

---

# Many statistical techniques for hypothesis testing

## z-test, t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA, RM-ANCOVA... WHAT?!

### Playing the game of statistical inference about population 'means'

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="img/lab7-difficultstat.jpeg" width=500&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

---

# Z-test

## What does it test?

### Whether a sample mean is different from a specified population mean

### Remember our Step 1: State null and alternative hypothesis

&lt;br&gt;

## But, when?

### We know the population mean and population standard deviation (VERY IDEAL!)

---

# Z-test

## Idea

### We do hypothesis testing (remember Step 1 through Step 4)

### In Step 3, when computing test statistic, we calculate a **z-statistic** when we know `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)`

`\(\LARGE z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\)`

## Are you familiar with this formula?

---

# Z-test

## When doing hypothesis, our Step 4 is to make a statistical decision

### See if our *p*-value is lower than `\(\alpha\)`

&lt;br&gt;

## This is equivalent to say...

### `\(|z_{obt}| &gt; |z_{crit}|\)`

### In case of z-test, `\(|z_{crit}|\)` is **1.645** for one-tailed test and **1.96** for two-tailed test

---

# Z-test

## Effect size

### If we find statistical significance, we quantify the size of the effect
### Means how many standard deviations (SDs) the sample mean lies from the population mean

&lt;br&gt;
## In z-test, the effect size is calculated as

&lt;center&gt;
`\(\LARGE d=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma}\)`

# Trailer

## Some critical thoughts on NHST

### Say we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Does this mean the alternative hypothesis is wrong?

### Say our *p*-value is .051 whereas `\(\alpha\)` is .05. Would it be reasonable to say there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis?

### Note that journals love *p*-values lower than .05 ONLY... is it fair?

## Q17 in HW4

### A professor finds that the average SAT score among all students attending his college is 1150 (sigma = 150). He polls his class of 25 students and finds that the average SAT score is 1,200. Suppose he computes a z test at a .05 level of significance. What is his decision?

### - to reject the null hypothesis for a two-tailed test, but to retain the null hypothesis for an one-tailed test &lt;br&gt; - to reject the null hypothesis for an one-tailed test, but to retain the null hypothesis for a two-tailed test &lt;br&gt; - to retain the null hypothesis &lt;br&gt; - to reject the null hypothesis
