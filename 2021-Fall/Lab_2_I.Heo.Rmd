# What are we going to do?

## Recap to give you a big picture

### Scales of measurement

### Data visualization

### Distribution

### Central tendency

## Group activity

---

# Eyes on the variables

## Think about the following:

### What is the type of the variable GPA? Is it categorical or numerical?

---

# Eyes on the variables

## To be categorical or numerical, that's the problem

### If measured on a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C), it is categorical (specifically, polynomial)

### If measured on a numerical grade (e.g., 4.0, 3.2, 3.7), it is numerical (specifically, continuous)

## To fully define and understand a variable, <br>we need to know how that variable is **measured**.

---

# Scaels of measurement

## The measurement scale

Type of information provided by the values of a variable

## Four scales of measurement
| Nominal | Ordinal | Interval       | Ratio          |
| :------ | :------ | :------------- | :------------- |
| Named   | Named   | Named          | Named          |
|         | Ordered | Ordered        | Ordered        |
|         |         | Equal interval | Equal interval |
|         |         |                | True 0 value   |
|<br>     |         |                |                |
|*Gender*    |*Letter grade (A~F)*|*Temperature* | *Height/Weight*|
|*Ethnicity* |*Political ideology*|*IQ Scores*   | *Age*          |
|*Color*     |*Likert scale*      |*SAT Scores*  | *Income*       |

# Data visualization

## Why do we visualize data?
Once we collect data about variables of interest, we want to present important information from the data!

## What did we learn?
- Frequency table
  - Simple frequency
  - Cumulative frequency
  - Relative frequency
  - Cumulative relative frequency
- Bar chart
- Pie chart
- Histogram
- Scatterplot

---

# Data visualization

## Frequency table
To show the count or the percentage of data points

## How can we distinguish different kinds of frequencies

|                     | Count                  | Percentage                    |
| :------------------ | :--------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Non Accumulation**| Simple frequency       | Relative frequency            | 
| **Accumulation**    | Cumulative frequency   | Cumulative relative frequency |

# Data visualization

## Bar chart

We use rectangular bars to represent the count or the proportion of categorical data

## Shall we see some examples?

R code from https://www.statmethods.net/

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Can you understand the plot?
```{r bar1, eval=FALSE}
# Simple Bar Plot
counts <- table(mtcars$gear)
barplot(counts, main="Car Distribution",
   xlab="Number of Gears")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="bar1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Horizontal bars are possible.
```{r bar2, eval=FALSE}
# Simple Horizontal Bar Plot with Added Labels
counts <- table(mtcars$gear)
barplot(counts, main="Car Distribution",
        horiz=TRUE,
  names.arg=c("3 Gears", "4 Gears", "5 Gears"))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="bar2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## You can even stack the bars!
```{r bar3, eval=FALSE}
# Stacked Bar Plot with Colors and Legend
counts <- table(mtcars$vs, mtcars$gear)
barplot(counts,
  main="Car Distribution by Gears and Engines",
  xlab="Number of Gears",
  col=c("darkblue","darkgreen"),
  legend = rownames(counts))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="bar3", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

## Pie chart

We use circular pies to represent the count or the proportion of categorical data

## Shall we see some examples?

R code from https://www.statmethods.net/

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Can you understand the plot?
```{r pie1, eval=FALSE}
# Simple Pie Chart
slices <- c(16, 12, 4, 10, 8)
lbls <-
  c("US", "South Africa", "Mexico",
    "South Korea", "Iran")
pie(slices, labels = lbls,
    main="Pie Chart of Countries")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="pie1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Let me present the 3D plot.
```{r pie2, eval=FALSE}
# 3D Exploded Pie Chart
library(plotrix)
slices <- c(16, 12, 4, 10, 8)
lbls <- c("US", "South Africa",
          "Mexico", "South Korea", "Iran")
pie3D(slices,labels=lbls,explode=0.1,
   main="Pie Chart of Countries ")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="pie2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

## Histogram

We use bins or buckets to represent the frequency distribution of data

## Shall we see some examples?

R code from https://www.statmethods.net/

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Can you understand the plot?
```{r hist1, eval=FALSE}
# Simple Histogram
hist(mtcars$mpg, col="lightblue")
# mpg stands for miles per gallon
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="hist1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## I increased the number of breaks.
```{r hist2, eval=FALSE}
# Colored Histogram with Different Number of Bins
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks=12, col="lightblue")
```
### Depending on the number of breaks, we can either gain or lose important information inherent in data.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="hist2", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Superimpose the curve that fits the data!
```{r hist3, eval=FALSE}
# Add a Normal Curve (Thanks to Peter Dalgaard)
x <- mtcars$mpg
h<-hist(x, breaks=10, col="lightblue",
   xlab="Miles Per Gallon",
   main="Histogram with Normal Curve")
xfit<-seq(min(x),max(x),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="navy", lwd=2)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="hist3", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

## Scatterplot

We scatter data points to see the relationship between the variables

## Shall we see some examples?

R code from https://www.statmethods.net/

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Can you understand the plot?
```{r sca1, eval=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg,
   main="Scatterplot Example",
   xlab="Car Weight ",
   ylab="Miles Per Gallon ", pch=19)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="sca1", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Data visualization

.pull-left[
## Adding a trend line helps!
```{r sca2, eval=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg,
   main="Scatterplot Example",
   xlab="Car Weight ",
   ylab="Miles Per Gallon ", pch=19)
abline(lm(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$wt), col="blue")
```

### The trend line is actually a regression line.

# Distribution

## Nerdy stat jokes...

---

# Distribution

## Why does distribution matter?

An intuitive way to understand how different values of a variable are spread over

## We learned...

- Normal distribution
- Positive skewness (*aka*. positively skewed)
- Negative skewness (*aka*. negatively skewed)
- ~~Paranormal distribution~~

---

# Distribution

.pull-left[
## Normal Distribution
```{r normal, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2093557522)
x = rnorm(10000,0,1)
hist(x, main="Normal Distribution", freq=FALSE,
     breaks=50)
lines(density(x), col='blue', lwd=3)
abline(v = c(mean(x),median(x)),
       col=c("green", "red"),
       lty=c(2,2), lwd=c(3, 3))
```
- Trailing off toward both left and right ends
- Any phenomenon that we would **normally** expect to observe
- Bell-shaped & symmetrical around the **center**
- Mean = Median = Mode
- Gaussian distribution (in honor of Carl Friedrich Gauss)
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="normal", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Distribution

.pull-left[
## Positive Skewness
```{r posskew, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(322)
x = rbeta(10000,2,5)
hist(x, main="Positive Skewness", freq=FALSE)
lines(density(x), col='blue', lwd=3)
abline(v = c(mean(x),median(x)),
       col=c("green", "red"),
       lty=c(2,2), lwd=c(3, 3))
```
- Trailing off toward the right end
- Mode < Median < Mean
- Score distribution of difficult exams
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="posskew", echo=FALSE}
```
]

---

# Distribution

.pull-left[
## Negative Skewness
```{r negskew, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(322)
x = rbeta(10000,5,2)
hist(x, main="Negative Skewness", freq=FALSE)
lines(density(x), col='blue', lwd=3)
abline(v = c(mean(x),median(x)),
       col=c("green", "red"),
       lty=c(2,2), lwd=c(3, 3))
```
- Trailing off toward the left end
- Mean < Median < Mode
- Score distribution of easy exams
]

.pull-right[
```{r, ref.label="negskew", echo=FALSE}
```
]

# Central tendency

## Why do we focus on central tendency?

Reflects where 'values of a variable (i.e., distribution)' are centered

## Three measures
- Mean
  - Sample mean = $\bar{X}$ = $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}}{n}$
  - Population mean = $\mu$ = $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}}{N}$
- Median, think after arranging values in an ascending numerical order 
  - Sample median = a value at the position $\frac{n+1}{2}$
- Mode = value that is the most frequent

---

# Central tendency

## Each measure is useful for different situations!

### Mean

- Most widely used and the best guess
- Vulnerable to outliers (i.e., extreme values)
- Does not make sense to nominal and ordinal scales (Can you calculate the mean of different genders?)

### Median

- Robust (i.e., less vulnerable) to outliers

### Mode

- Very useful to nominal and ordinal scales

# Group activity

## Case 1

Estuardo is interested in how people in California give ratings to the taste of ranch pizza. He collected 20 people in Los Angeles and made a frequency table on the frequency of pizza ratings (1 through 5).

| Ratings | Frequency (Freq.)  | Cumulative Freq. | Relative Freq. | Cumulative Relative Freq. |
| :------ | :--------- | :------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| 1 | 3 |  |  
| 2 | 2 |  | 
| 3 | 5 |  | 
| 4 | 6 |  |  
| 5 | 4 |  | 

## Can you answer below?
- Can you fill in the blanks of cumulative freq., relative freq., and cumulative relative freq.?
- What is the cumulative relative freq. for giving 2 stars or lower?

---

# Group activity

## Case 2

Ari has been working as a data scientist at Regal. Since Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is on the screen, she wants to know how people rate the movie. She made a questionnaire on which score you want to give to the movie. The score ranges from 0 to 100 on a 5-point scale. So far, she has collected responses from 19 people, which is summarized in the following table:

| Scores | 65 | 70 | 75 | 80 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 100 |
| :------ | :----- | :----- | :------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| **Frequency** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 5 |

## Can you answer below?
- How does the distribution look like? Normally distributed, negatively skewed, or positively skewed?
- What are the mean, the median, and the mode of the sample? Feel free to use a calculator, if necessary.
- Can you calculate the population mean?
- Imagine Ari receives one response from a person who is very disappointed with the movie. If that person gives a score of 0, how do the mean, the median, and the mode would change?
