# Big picture

## Read the question carefully

### Which statistical technique?

### One-tailed or two-tailed?

### Test-statistic

### Critical value from the table

### Effect size

---

# One-way ANOVA

## Effect size

### $\LARGE \eta^2 = \LARGE \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{total}}$

### Magnitude of the between group effect

### Compares the size of the variance between groups with the total variance

### ~~% of the variance in the DV is explained by the IV

# One-way ANOVA

### A pharmaceutical company conducts an experiment to test the effect of new cholesterol medication. The company selects 15 subjects randomly from a larger population. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Within each treatment group, subjects receive a different dose of the new medication. In Group 1, subjects receive 0 mg/day; in Group 2, 50 mg/day; and in Group 3, 100 mg/day. After 30 days, doctors measure the cholesterol level of each subject. The results for all 15 subjects appear in the table below:

# One-way ANOVA

## In conducting this experiment, the experimenter had two research questions

### 1. Does dosage level have a significant effect on cholesterol level? (hypothesis testing) $\alpha$=0.05

### 2. How strong is the effect of dosage level on cholesterol level? (effect size calculation)

### 2. How strong is the effect of dosage level on cholesterol level? (effect size calculation)

### $\eta^2 = \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{total}} = \frac{6240}{15240}=0.41$

### 41% of the variance in the cholesterol level is explained by the new medication methods
